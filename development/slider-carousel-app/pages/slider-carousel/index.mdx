## ReuseSliderCarousel Component Docs
The `ReuseSliderCarousel` component is a reusable carousel component that displays a collection of slides. It provides functionality for `automatic slide transitions`, `navigation buttons`, and `customizable styles`.

- React component that renders a slider carousel using the `ReuseSliderCarousel` component from the `@locoworks/reusejs-react-slider-carousel` library. The slider displays a list of slides, and it automatically transitions between slides at a specified interval.

- The slider component from `ReuseSliderCarousel` has the feature to go to the next or previous slide when clicked, based on the click position. It detects the click position relative to the `slider container` and determines whether the user clicked on the left or right side of the container.

## Props
- `slideInterval` (number): The interval (in milliseconds) between slide transitions.
- `slides` (React.ReactNode[]): An array of ReactNode elements representing the slides to be displayed.
- `loop` (boolean): A boolean value indicating whether the carousel should loop back to the first slide after reaching the last slide.
- `wrapperClasses` (string): Additional CSS classes to be applied to the wrapper container element.
- `enableButtons` (boolean): A boolean value indicating whether navigation buttons should be displayed.
- `previousButton` (React.ReactNode): Custom ReactNode element to be used as the previous button to back on the previous slide.
- `nextButton` (React.ReactNode): Custom ReactNode element to be used as the next button to go to the next slide.
- `animationStyle` (string): Determines the animation style of the slider. Set this prop to 'continue' to enable continuous looping with slide chaining. When set to 'continue', the slider will seamlessly transition from the last slide to the first slide, creating a continuous loop effect.
- `sliderContainerClasses` (string): This custom **class**, "slide-right-to-left", is specifically created for animation purposes.
You have the flexibility to create personalized animations by designing your own custom animations. Simply replace the default class name 'slide-right-to-left' with your own animation class name, allowing you to achieve your desired animation effects.

## Examples
### Slider without button
<SimpleSlider />

```js path=../../components/slider-carousel/Example/SimpleSlider name=SimpleSlider
```

### Slider With Buttons

- If the `enableButtons` prop is set to `true`, the ReuseSliderCarousel component will display next and previous buttons instead of relying on the container click event. The container click event handling code can be removed in this case.

<SliderWithButton />

```js path=../../components/slider-carousel/Example/SliderWithButton name=SliderWithButton
```

### Slider With LinearSlideChain

<SliderWithLinearSlide />

```js path=../../components/slider-carousel/Example/SliderWithLinearSlide name=SliderWithLinearSlide
```

export default ({ children }) => {
  return <div className="prose max-w-full mx-4 pb-10" >{children}</div>
};
