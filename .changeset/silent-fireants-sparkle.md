Created 3 Components inside DatePicker Component-

1. Calendar which includes all the calendar related UI
2. SingleDatePicker which includes using dayzed and passing props to Calendar
3. HeadlessDatePicker which is a custom UI for date input and followed.
   There also is a useDateHelpers hook being used which extracts the date helper function (isValid) to be used inside DatePicker.
